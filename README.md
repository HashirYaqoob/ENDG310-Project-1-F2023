# ENDG 310
## Project #1 - Visualizing Data

For this project, I was able to investigate how carbon diozide levels and temperature data from around the world are correlated in a linear fashion. Through this project I was able to understand how the impacts of global warming can be seen through an increase in carbon dioxide levels resulting in a very visible increase in average temperature as well. It is important to note; however, that both of these datasets fluctuate with time, one more uniformly than the other. The carbon dioxide data can be seen going up and down with the seasons and travelling in an upwards direction very uniformly. The temperature on the other hand is more radical with spikes and crashes throughout the year but rolling averages that reflect the seasons of the year. As time progressed we can see how the temperature data shows more and more deviation from the mean which can be a representation of how the climate and weather is changing. More radical weather has been seen not only in Canada but also across the world at this scale.

The data I was able to collect was from these two sources:
1. https://datahub.io/core/global-temp (Temperature Data)
2. https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html (Carbon Dioxide Level Data)


For the data management in this project, I did have to change the temperature data for easier representation. For example, I did have to change the date from a (YYYY-MM-DD) format to a decimal date format and then proceed to flip it so it would show a chronological progression. This work is in my Data_processing.ipynb fle and shows all the work I did to make the dataset more compatible with my needs. 

The infographic itself is a visual compilation of my investigation and presents all my findings with trendlines and cross plots. The infographic is interactive as the figures enlarge when the cursor hovers over them, making them easier to see and understand. All my work for this lab apart from the data management is present in the ENDG310-Project-1-F2023.ipynb file in a chronological order of my workflow.
